    <h1> 100 Days of code</h1>
    <h2> November 17 - Day one of 100 days of code.</h2>
    <p> Today, I'm attempting to set up terminal on mac to Git Hub. I'm starting the one hundred days of code from day one. Yesterday I worked on the pickle project, I added styling to pictures and buttons. I will add a screenshot on what I worked on for pickle project below. Today, I plan on working on the contact page for capstone project. 
        Here are some pictures from yesterday's work: 
        <div class="dayOnepics">
        <img class = "imageOne" src="./pictures/update1.png" alt="Main Pickle Page">
        <img class = "imageTwo" src="./pictures/update2.png" alt="Pickle Jars">
        </div>
    </p>
    <h2>November 18 - Day two of 100 days of code.</h2>
    <p>Today, I worked on setting up the contact page for capstone project. I plan to add a minimalist contact page and social media icons as part of the non profit website. I think that since there will be many pictures and videos on the webpage that having a contact page that is minimalist and straight forward will be a better for the user. I will try to create, see how it looks and make adjustments from there. Additionally, I've been experimenting with Xcode. It's a bit confusing to figure out at the moment, but I will watch videos and read articles to get a better understanding.</p>
    <h2>November 19 - Day three of 100 days of code.</h2>
    <p> Today, I started documentation on Xcode. I opened the landmarks file for the workspace. I experiemented with the files. Addionally, I followed up with classmate about class today. Will meet with the group to go over project. Also, reviews replit.  </p>
