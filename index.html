   <li>November 17 - Day one of 100 days of code. 
    <p> Today, I'm attempting to set up terminal on mac to Git Hub. I'm starting the one hundred days of code from day one. Yesterday I worked on the pickle project, I added styling to pictures and buttons. I will add a screenshot on what I worked on for pickle project below. Today, I plan on working on the contact page for capstone project. 
        Here are some pictures from yesterday's work: 
        <div class="dayOnepics">
        <img class = "imageOne" src="./pictures/update1.png" alt="Main Pickle Page">
        <img class = "imageTwo" src="./pictures/update2.png" alt="Pickle Jars">
        </div>
    </p> </li>
    <li> November 18 - Day two of 100 days of code.
    <p>Today, I worked on setting up the contact page for capstone project. I plan to add a minimalist contact page and social media icons as part of the non profit website. I think that since there will be many pictures and videos on the webpage that having a contact page that is minimalist and straight forward will be a better for the user. I will try to create, see how it looks and make adjustments from there. Additionally, I've been experimenting with Xcode. It's a bit confusing to figure out at the moment, but I will watch videos and read articles to get a better understanding.</p> </li>
    <li>November 19 - Day three of 100 days of code. 
    <p> Today, I started documentation on Xcode. I opened the landmarks file for the workspace. I experiemented with the files. Addionally, I followed up with classmate about class today. Will meet with the group to go over project. Also, reviewed replit.  </p> </li>
    <li>November 20 - Day four of 100 days of code.
    <p> Today, I worked on contact page for capstone project. I added a picture to the heading of where contact us is placed. I might change the font and weight of font to make the words stand out more. I also added some styling to the containers and divs of contact page. This is what page looks like so far: <img class="contactUpdate1" src="./pictures/contactPage.png" alt="Most recent updates to contact page"> </p> </li>
    <li> November 21 - Day five of 100 days of code.
        <p>
            Today, I worked on getting to know Xcode. I was able to play around with the workspace and see how different space changes. For example, the iphone app is different than the rest of the options. Additionally, I got a better understanding of media queries. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>November 22 - Day six of 100 days of code.
        <p>
            Today, I further experiemented with Xcode. I was able to adjust and add pictures to an app. I changed the font and color of the text. I adjusted the size of the picture and added a button with a toggle. I find that Xcode is easier to understand. I plan on continuing to learn more to add on to the app practice. This is the practice that I worked on today:

    </li>
    <li> November 23 - Day seven of 100 days of code. 
        <p>
            Today, I worked on watching video for Xcode. I looked for video that were beginning friendly and that were updated for the latest version of Xcode. I plan on continuing to work on group project later on this week. I also want to make this journal look like a journal.
