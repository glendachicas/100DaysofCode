    <h1> 100 Days of code</h1>
    <h2> November 17 - Day one of 100 days of code.</h2>
    <p> Today, I'm attempting to set up terminal on mac to Git Hub. I'm starting the one hundred days of code from day one. Yesterday I worked on the pickle project, I added styling to pictures and buttons. I will add a screenshot on what I worked on for pickle project below. Today, I plan on working on the contact page for capstone project. 
        Here are some pictures from yesterday's work: 
        <div class="dayOnepics">

        </div>
